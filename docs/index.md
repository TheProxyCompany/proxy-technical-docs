## The Reliability Challenge

Language models have incredible generative capabilities, but their inherent stochastic nature makes them unreliable for production applications that require:

- Consistent output formats
- Guaranteed structural validity
- Reliable behavior across inputs
- Safe tool and API interactions
- Deterministic control flow

Our technologies address these challenges through principled engineering approaches that preserve the creative power of LLMs while providing the reliability guarantees needed for critical applications.

## Technology Solutions

### [Proxy Structuring Engine](/pse/)

PSE is a state-of-the-art system that guarantees LLMs will generate outputs conforming to specified structures. Using an innovative architecture that works directly with the LLM's token generation process, PSE provides robust structural guarantees while preserving the model's creative capabilities. For detailed information, please visit the [PSE documentation](/pse/).

### [Proxy Base Agent](/pba/)

PBA is a stateful, tool-enabled agent built with the Proxy Structuring Engine. It implements a state machine architecture that guides language models through planning states (Thinking, Scratchpad, Inner Monologue) and action states (Tool calls, Python code), creating reliable, structured agent behavior. For detailed information, please visit the [PBA documentation](/pba/).
