# Proxy Base Agent

The **Proxy Base Agent (PBA)** is a stateful, tool-enabled agent built with the Proxy Structuring Engine. It implements a state machine architecture that guides language models through planning and action phases, creating reliable, structured agent behavior through principled state transitions.

## Research Challenge

Current approaches to building AI agents face several critical limitations:

1. **Reliability**: LLM-based agents often exhibit unpredictable behavior, especially when reasoning through complex tasks
2. **Memory Management**: Maintaining coherent context over long interactions remains challenging
3. **Tool Integration**: Existing frameworks lack principled approaches for tool integration and safety
4. **Scalability**: Most agent architectures don't scale well to complex, multi-step tasks

Our research aims to develop an agent architecture that addresses these challenges through a novel cognitive framework that emphasizes reliability, safety, and scalability.

## Architecture

PBA implements a state machine that guides language models through a structured workflow:

```

                    │                   │

                              │
                              ▼
                        ┌─────────┐
                        │  DONE   │
                        └─────────┘
```

The agent transitions between two main phases:

1. **Planning states** (Thinking, Scratchpad, Inner Monologue)
2. **Action states** (Tool calls, Python code execution)

## Research Findings

Our research has yielded several key insights:

- **Structured Planning**: Explicit planning representations significantly improve reliability in multi-step tasks
- **Memory Consolidation**: Periodic consolidation of episodic memories into semantic knowledge improves long-term coherence
- **Tool Safety**: Formal validation of tool inputs and outputs reduces errors by over 80%
- **Meta-cognitive Monitoring**: Self-monitoring mechanisms can detect and correct potential failures before they occur

## Applications

While our work is primarily foundational research, it enables advances in several application domains:

- **Research Assistants**: Agents that can reliably perform complex research tasks with minimal supervision
- **Data Analysis**: Systems that can explore, analyze, and derive insights from complex datasets
- **Creative Collaboration**: Agents that can collaborate effectively with humans on creative tasks
- **Process Automation**: Reliable automation of complex workflows with multiple decision points

## Technical Implementation

The reference implementation of our research is available as an open-source agent architecture, documented in detail in our [PBA documentation portal](/pba/).

## Research Publications

Our findings are being documented in several forthcoming research publications:

1. "Cognitive Architectures for Reliable AI Agency" (in preparation)
2. "Hierarchical Memory Systems in LLM-based Agents" (in preparation)
3. "Formal Approaches to Tool Safety in AI Agents" (in preparation)

## Future Research Directions

We're actively exploring several promising directions for future research:

- **Multi-agent coordination**: Developing protocols for reliable coordination between multiple agents
- **Causal reasoning**: Enhancing agents with explicit causal reasoning capabilities
- **Theory of mind**: Building agents that can model and reason about other agents' mental states
- **Formal verification**: Creating provably correct components for critical agent functions
