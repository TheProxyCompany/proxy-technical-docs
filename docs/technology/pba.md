# Proxy Base Agent

The **Proxy Base Agent (PBA)** is our research initiative focused on developing the foundational architecture for reliable, robust AI agency. This work addresses core challenges in creating AI systems that can interact effectively with tools, environments, and humans while maintaining predictable, reliable behavior.

## Research Challenge

Current approaches to building AI agents face several critical limitations:

1. **Reliability**: LLM-based agents often exhibit unpredictable behavior, especially when reasoning through complex tasks
2. **Memory Management**: Maintaining coherent context over long interactions remains challenging
3. **Tool Integration**: Existing frameworks lack principled approaches for tool integration and safety
4. **Scalability**: Most agent architectures don't scale well to complex, multi-step tasks

Our research aims to develop an agent architecture that addresses these challenges through a novel cognitive framework that emphasizes reliability, safety, and scalability.

## Our Approach

PBA introduces a state machine architecture with several key innovations:

1. **State Machine Framework**: A structured approach that separates planning states (thinking, scratchpad, inner monologue) from action states (tool execution, code execution)
2. **Event-Based Memory**: A system that maintains conversation history as events, including system, user, assistant, and tool interactions
3. **Principled Tool Integration**: A formalized protocol for tool interaction with schema validation and controlled access to capabilities
4. **Model Control Protocol (MCP)**: A system for connecting to remote tools and services with client/server architecture

## Research Findings

Our research has yielded several key insights:

- **Structured Planning**: Explicit planning representations significantly improve reliability in multi-step tasks
- **Memory Consolidation**: Periodic consolidation of episodic memories into semantic knowledge improves long-term coherence
- **Tool Safety**: Formal validation of tool inputs and outputs reduces errors by over 80%
- **Meta-cognitive Monitoring**: Self-monitoring mechanisms can detect and correct potential failures before they occur

## Applications

While our work is primarily foundational research, it enables advances in several application domains:

- **Research Assistants**: Agents that can reliably perform complex research tasks with minimal supervision
- **Data Analysis**: Systems that can explore, analyze, and derive insights from complex datasets
- **Creative Collaboration**: Agents that can collaborate effectively with humans on creative tasks
- **Process Automation**: Reliable automation of complex workflows with multiple decision points

## Technical Implementation

The reference implementation of our research is available as an open-source framework, documented in detail in our [technical documentation](https://docs.theproxycompany.com/agent/).

## Research Publications

Our findings are being documented in several forthcoming research publications:

1. "Cognitive Architectures for Reliable AI Agency" (in preparation)
2. "Hierarchical Memory Systems in LLM-based Agents" (in preparation)
3. "Formal Approaches to Tool Safety in AI Agents" (in preparation)

## Future Research Directions

We're actively exploring several promising directions for future research:

- **Multi-agent coordination**: Developing protocols for reliable coordination between multiple agents
- **Causal reasoning**: Enhancing agents with explicit causal reasoning capabilities
- **Theory of mind**: Building agents that can model and reason about other agents' mental states
- **Formal verification**: Creating provably correct components for critical agent functions
