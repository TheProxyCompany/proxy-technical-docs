# About The Proxy Company

The Proxy Company is an independent research and development lab founded in 2023 by a team of researchers and engineers focused on advancing reliable, safe AI systems.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to pioneer fundamental research that enables the next generation of reliable AI systems. We believe that as AI becomes more capable and more integrated into critical systems, ensuring reliability, safety, and predictability becomes essential.

## Our Approach

We take a first-principles approach to AI research, focusing on foundational challenges rather than incremental improvements. Our work typically:

1. Identifies fundamental limitations in current approaches
2. Develops novel theoretical frameworks to address these limitations
3. Creates reference implementations to validate our theoretical insights
4. Publishes our findings to advance the broader research community

## Research Focus

Our research spans several interconnected areas:

- **Structured Output Generation**: Making LLMs reliably produce outputs in specific formats
- **Agent Architectures**: Developing more reliable, robust agent systems
- **Safety & Alignment**: Ensuring AI systems behave as intended and align with human values
- **Formal Methods**: Applying mathematical rigor to AI system design

## Our Team

The Proxy Company brings together a multidisciplinary team of researchers and engineers with backgrounds in:

- Machine Learning
- Software Engineering
- Systems Design
- Formal Methods
- Cognitive Science
- Linguistics

## Open Source Commitment

We believe that open, collaborative research is essential for advancing AI for the benefit of humanity. We make our research implementations available as open-source projects and actively contribute to the broader research community.

## Research Ethics

We are committed to conducting our research with the highest ethical standards. We consider potential applications and implications of our work, and we design our systems with safety and human well-being as primary considerations.

## Funding

Our research is funded through a combination of research grants, strategic partnerships, and private investment. We maintain our research independence while collaborating with organizations that share our commitment to advancing reliable AI systems.
