# Key Features

The Proxy Base Agent (PBA) provides a comprehensive architecture for building reliable AI agents. Here are the key features that distinguish PBA from other agent frameworks.

## Hierarchical Memory System

PBA implements a sophisticated multi-tier memory architecture:

- **Working Memory**: Short-term context for the current task
- **Episodic Memory**: Records of past interactions and experiences
- **Semantic Memory**: Long-term knowledge base for conceptual information
- **Procedural Memory**: Stored routines and procedures for common tasks

This hierarchical system enables agents to maintain coherent context across complex interactions while efficiently managing memory resources.

## Principled Tool Integration

PBA's tool integration framework provides safe, reliable tool usage:

- **Formal Interface Definition**: Strict typing and validation for tool inputs/outputs
- **Error Handling Protocol**: Standardized approach to tool failures
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for tool access
- **Tool Registry**: Centralized management of available tools
- **Versioning Support**: Handle tool API changes gracefully

## Structured Reasoning

The PBA reasoning system implements research-backed approaches to reliable cognitive processing:

- **Explicit Planning**: Formalized planning representations
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Controlled progress through multi-step procedures
- **Chain-of-Thought Integration**: Built-in support for reasoning traces
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Explicit representation of confidence levels
- **Alternative Consideration**: Exploration of multiple solution paths

## Reflexive Monitoring

PBA includes sophisticated self-monitoring capabilities:

- **Execution Validation**: Automatic checking of execution correctness
- **Expectation Management**: Comparing outcomes to predicted results
- **Error Detection**: Identifying both logical and factual errors
- **Self-Correction**: Mechanisms for recovering from detected errors
- **Performance Analytics**: Tracking and analyzing agent performance

## Safety Guarantees

PBA is built with safety as a foundational principle:

- **Sandboxed Execution**: Contained environment for tool operations
- **Input Sanitization**: Automatic cleaning of potentially harmful inputs
- **Output Filtering**: Detection and mitigation of problematic outputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protections against resource exhaustion
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive record of all agent actions and decisions

## Framework Agnostic

PBA works with all major machine learning frameworks:

- **PyTorch**: Full integration with HuggingFace Transformers
- **MLX**: Native support for Apple Silicon optimization
- **TensorFlow**: Seamless integration with TensorFlow models
- **JAX**: Support for JAX-based models and transformations

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

PBA supports complex multi-agent systems:

- **Agent Communication Protocol**: Standardized message passing
- **Role Definition**: Explicit agent specialization
- **Shared Context**: Efficient knowledge sharing between agents
- **Coordination Mechanisms**: Tools for managing agent collaborations
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Support for supervisor/worker relationships

## Extensible Architecture

PBA is designed for extensibility and customization:

- **Modular Components**: All subsystems can be extended or replaced
- **Plugin System**: Easy integration of new capabilities
- **Custom Memory Implementations**: Support for specialized memory systems
- **Tool Development API**: Framework for creating new tools
- **Event System**: Hooks for integrating with external systems
