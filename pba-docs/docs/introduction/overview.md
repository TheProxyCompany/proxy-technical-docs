# Overview

## What is the Proxy Base Agent?

The **Proxy Base Agent (PBA)** is a cognitive architecture designed to build reliable, robust AI agents. Unlike conventional agent frameworks that directly prompt language models, PBA implements a structured approach to reasoning, memory management, and tool interaction based on research in cognitive science and formal methods.

PBA addresses critical limitations in current agent architectures:

1. **Reasoning Reliability**: By structuring the reasoning process with explicit planning and reflection phases
2. **Context Management**: Through a hierarchical memory system that maintains coherence across complex interactions
3. **Tool Integration**: With a principled approach to tool safety and validation
4. **Scalability**: By implementing an architecture that scales to complex multi-step tasks

## Core Architecture

PBA's architecture consists of four main components:

### 1. Reasoning Engine

The reasoning engine implements a three-phase cognitive process:

- **Planning**: Explicit formulation of plans and strategies before execution
- **Execution**: Controlled interaction with tools and environments
- **Reflection**: Meta-cognitive monitoring and adjustment of plans and strategies

This structured approach to reasoning significantly improves reliability in complex tasks.

### 2. Memory System

PBA's memory system is hierarchical, with three main components:

- **Working Memory**: The active context for the current task
- **Episodic Memory**: A record of past interactions and experiences
- **Semantic Memory**: Distilled knowledge and generalizations from experiences

This system allows agents to maintain coherence across long interactions and learn from experience.

### 3. Tool Registry

The tool registry manages tool integration with:

- Formal specifications of tool capabilities
- Input validation to prevent harmful commands
- Output validation to ensure reliable consumption of tool results
- Safe execution in controlled environments

### 4. Agent Core

The agent core coordinates all components and implements:

- Task management
- Conversation management
- Configuration and customization
- Performance monitoring

## Research Foundations

PBA is built on research in:

- **Cognitive Architectures**: Drawing on models of human reasoning from cognitive science
- **Formal Methods**: Using techniques from formal verification to ensure safety properties
- **AI Safety**: Implementing approaches from alignment research
- **Systems Design**: Applying principles from reliable systems engineering

## Who Should Use PBA?

PBA is designed for researchers and developers who:

- Need reliable agent behavior for critical applications
- Are building complex agents that perform multi-step reasoning
- Want agents that can maintain coherence across long interactions
- Are concerned about tool safety and alignment
