    A cognitive architecture for creating reliable, robust AI agents
  </p>
</div>

The **Proxy Base Agent (PBA)** is a research-backed framework for building reliable AI agents that can reason effectively, interact with tools, and maintain coherent context across complex tasks. PBA addresses the critical challenges of agent reliability, safety, and scalability through a novel cognitive architecture designed from first principles.

## Key Features

- **Modular Reasoning Framework**: Structured approach to planning, reflection, and execution
- **Hierarchical Memory System**: Multi-tier memory for managing different types of knowledge
- **Principled Tool Integration**: Formalized protocol for safe tool interaction
- **Reflexive Monitoring**: Built-in mechanisms for monitoring and correcting agent behavior
- **Framework Agnostic**: Compatible with major LLM frameworks (PyTorch, MLX, TensorFlow, JAX)

## How It Works

PBA uses a cognitive architecture inspired by research in AI, cognitive science, and formal methods:

1. **Planning Layer**: Explicit planning representations for reliable multi-step reasoning
2. **Execution Layer**: Controlled tool integration with formal input/output validation
3. **Reflection Layer**: Meta-cognitive monitoring to detect and correct failures
4. **Memory System**: Hierarchical memory with working, episodic, and semantic components

This architecture provides a robust foundation for building agents that can handle complex tasks reliably, even in unpredictable environments.

## Getting Started

```python
from pba import Agent, ToolRegistry
from pba.memory import HierarchicalMemory

# Define tools
tools = ToolRegistry()
tools.register("calculator", Calculator())
tools.register("web_search", WebSearch())

# Create agent with hierarchical memory
memory = HierarchicalMemory()
agent = Agent(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3-8b-instruct",
    tools=tools,
    memory=memory
)

# Run agent on a task
result = agent.run("Research the latest developments in quantum computing and summarize the key findings.")
print(result)
```

## Use Cases

- **Research Assistants**: Agents that can reliably perform complex research tasks
- **Data Analysis**: Systems that explore, analyze, and derive insights from datasets
- **Creative Collaboration**: Agents that collaborate effectively with humans on creative tasks
- **Process Automation**: Reliable automation of complex workflows with multiple decision points
- **Knowledge Management**: Systems that organize and synthesize knowledge across domains
