# Proxy Base Agent

The **Proxy Base Agent (PBA)** is a foundation agent built with the **Proxy Structuring Engine (PSE)**, which provides the underlying framework for managing the agent's state, controlling the flow of execution, and interacting with the language model.

The base agent is designed to **rapidly prototype and develop LLM-powered agents** with a focus on **local execution, stateful interactions, and extensibility**.

The **PSE** augments **language models** at runtime, allowing them to function effectively as agents - capable of adhering to predefined workflows, multi-step reasoning, and external tool usage.

## What is an Agent?

> An agent is a system that takes actions in an environment.

## Proxy Base Agent

The Proxy Base Agent operates through a structured workflow defined by a **state graph**, transitioning through clearly defined **planning** and **action** phases:

    end

        CodeAction["Python Code"]

        ActionChoice -- "Tool" --> ToolAction
        ActionChoice -- "Code" --> CodeAction
    end

    Plan --> PlanLoop{"More planning needed?"}
    PlanLoop -- "Yes" --> Plan
    PlanLoop -- "No" --> Action

    Action --> Finish([Finish])

```

### Planning Phase

The agent first enters a planning loop, choosing between internal states to reason about the task:

*   **Thinking**: Deliberate analysis and planning.
*   **Scratchpad**: Quick notes and working memory.
*   **Inner Monologue**: Detailed self-reflection and narrative reasoning.

### Action Phase

Once planning is complete, the agent selects an action to interact with the environment:

*   **Tool Calls**: Invokes external tools or APIs via guaranteed schemas.
*   **Python Code Execution**: (Optional) Runs Python code snippets.

### State Graph

This state graph describes the base behavior of the agent.
It can be extended and modified to support more complex agentic behaviors.

## Key Capabilities

PBA leverages PSE to deliver capabilities beyond conventional agent frameworks:

*   **Guaranteed Stateful Execution:** Define agent workflows as explicit HSMs (e.g., Plan âž” Act). PSE ensures the LLM follows the defined states and transitions precisely.
*   **100% Reliable Tool Use:** Eliminate runtime errors from malformed API calls or hallucinated function arguments. PSE guarantees tool calls match their required schema during generation.
*   **Dynamic Runtime Adaptation (MCP):** Connect to external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers on-the-fly. PBA instantly integrates new tools and capabilities with the same structural guarantees, no restarts needed.
*   **Model & Framework Agnostic:** Run reliable agents locally using your preferred LLMs and backends (MLX, PyTorch supported).
*   **Modular & Extensible:** Build specialized agents by adding custom tools, defining new states, or modifying the core HSM architecture.
