# Proxy Base Agent

The **Proxy Base Agent (PBA)** is a foundation agent built with the **Proxy Structuring Engine (PSE)**, which provides the underlying framework for managing the agent's state, controlling the flow of execution, and interacting with the language model.

The base agent is designed to **rapidly prototype and develop LLM-powered agents** with a focus on **local execution, stateful interactions, and extensibility**.

The **PSE** augments **language models** at runtime, allowing them to function effectively as agents - capable of adhering to predefined workflows, multi-step reasoning, and external tool usage.

## What is an Agent?

> An agent is a system that takes actions in an environment.

## Proxy Base Agent

The Proxy Base Agent operates through a structured workflow defined by a **state graph**, transitioning through clearly defined **planning** and **action** phases:

    end

### Planning Phase

The agent engages in iterative reasoning through multiple cognitive states:

- **Thinking**: High-level reasoning and goal setting.
- **Scratchpad**: Intermediate notes and working memory.
- **Inner Monologue**: Reflective reasoning and self-assessment.

### Action Phase

After sufficient planning, the agent transitions to executing actions:

- **Tool Calls**: Interaction with external APIs or custom tools.
- **Python Code Execution**: Direct execution of Python scripts for complex tasks.

### State Graph

This state graph describes the base behavior of the agent.
It can be extended and modified to support more complex agentic behaviors.

## Key Capabilities

PBA leverages PSE to deliver capabilities beyond conventional agent frameworks:

*   üß† **True Stateful Execution:** Define and enforce complex workflows using an explicit HSM (Plan ‚ûî Act). PSE guarantees state consistency.
*   ‚úÖ **100% Reliable Tool Use:** Eliminate runtime errors from malformed API calls or hallucinated arguments via schema validation *during generation*.
*   ‚ö° **Dynamic Runtime Adaptation (MCP):** Integrate new tools on-the-fly via the Model Context Protocol with guaranteed reliability.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Predictable Control Flow:** Explicitly define agent reasoning patterns and action sequences for deterministic behavior.
*   üîå **Universal LLM Compatibility:** Designed for local models using various backends (MLX, PyTorch supported).
*   üß© **Modular & Extensible:** Build bespoke agents by adding custom tools, states, or modifying the core HSM architecture.
