# Quickstart

This quickstart guide will walk you through running the Proxy Base Agent and interacting with it.

1.  **Run the Agent:**

    After installing the agent (see [Installation](installation.md)), you can start it using the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m agent
    ```

2.  **Interactive Setup:**

    The agent will guide you through an interactive setup process. This allows you to configure the agent's parameters.

3.  **Interact with the Agent:**

    Once the setup is complete, you can interact with the agent. The agent will process your input, transition through its states, and potentially use tools to achieve its goal. Observe the agent's output to understand its reasoning and actions.
