# Framework Adapters

PSE is designed to be framework-agnostic, supporting multiple machine learning frameworks through its adapter system. This page explains how to use PSE with different ML frameworks and how to optimize for each.

## Supported Frameworks

PSE officially supports the following frameworks:

- [PyTorch](#pytorch-adapter)
- [MLX](#mlx-adapter)
- [TensorFlow](#tensorflow-adapter)
- [JAX](#jax-adapter)

More documentation coming soon.
