# Proxy Structuring Engine Overview

The Proxy Structuring Engine (PSE) is a pioneering technology that transforms stochastic language models into deterministic, state-driven systems for generating reliable structured outputs.

## What is PSE?

PSE addresses a fundamental challenge in working with large language models: ensuring that they produce outputs that conform to specific structures while preserving their creative capabilities.

## Key Features

- State machine architecture for predictable output
- Token-level intervention for guaranteed schema conformance
- Framework-agnostic design that works with any LLM
- Minimal performance overhead
