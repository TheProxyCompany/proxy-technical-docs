# PSE Core Architecture

The Proxy Structuring Engine is built on a high-performance C++ core that implements a novel non-deterministic finite state automaton (NFA) parsing algorithm. This page provides a detailed look at the internal architecture of PSE's core implementation, which is distributed as a precompiled binary via PyPI (pse-core).
