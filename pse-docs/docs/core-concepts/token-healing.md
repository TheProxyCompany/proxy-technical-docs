# Token Healing

Token healing is a key feature of PSE that improves the robustness of the structured generation process.

## What is Token Healing?

Token healing is a process that allows PSE to recover from potential generation errors by automatically correcting token sequences that are close to, but not exactly matching, the expected structure.

## Benefits

- Increased model flexibility
- More natural text generation
- Reduced hallucinations
- Better handling of unexpected token sequences
