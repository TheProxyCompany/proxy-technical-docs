# Token Healing

Token healing is an error recovery mechanism in PSE that enables robust handling of tokenization mismatches between language model tokens and grammar rules.

## What is Token Healing?

Token healing allows PSE to recover from situations where a model generates tokens that don't perfectly align with the grammar's expected tokens. Instead of rejecting these tokens outright, PSE can "heal" them by finding valid prefixes and continuing generation.

More information coming soon.
